			<p>Origin is a research-oriented student organization designed to promote student exploration into research. With students being ineligible to perform research or unable to find research opportunities, we wanted to help ease this process. We hope that our organization will help students navigate the research field and ease their student workload in the process.</p>

			<p>We can provide an easier path to help students get involved in research. The research field is expensive and complex. We want to give students the chance to understand the scientific literature, so they can become well-rounded members of society regardless of their career path. In addition, being able to work on research projects demonstrates your problem-solving skills, organizational skills, and many other skills that future exployers will be looking forward to seeing.</p>
